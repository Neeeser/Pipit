/// `WhisperKit` is a class with no `Sendable` conformance, so under Swift 6 it
/// can neither be returned from its own nonisolated initializer into an actor
/// nor handed to its own nonisolated `transcribe` from one. Which of those two a
/// given compiler release diagnoses varies: 6.4 accepts both call sites and
/// 6.1.2 rejects all three, so the type is kept out of actor-isolated code
/// entirely rather than left to region inference.
///
/// What makes the unchecked conformance sound is where the box lives.
/// `LocalModelManager` holds the only reference, in a private property, and
/// every path to `transcribe` is an isolated method on that actor, so calls
/// arrive one at a time and no two threads are ever inside the pipeline.
