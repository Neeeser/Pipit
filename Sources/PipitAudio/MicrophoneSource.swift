        // unit at an 8-channel device took its input scope to 8 channels while
        // its output scope stayed at the 1 channel the node was instantiated
        // with, and the output scope is what `outputFormat(forBus: 0)` reports.
        // The track is written at that 1 channel. The scan runs only above two
        // channels, so it does not run there, and which of the device's
