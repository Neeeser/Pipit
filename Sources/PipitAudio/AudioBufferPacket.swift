/// That the sub-device's streams come first and the tap's comes last is

/// ordering. Matching on channel count is the fallback for a list where it does
/// not hold.

/// Channel count cannot be the first rule, because it picks whichever stream
/// happens to carry as many channels as the tap, and plenty of devices carry
/// two. A stereo USB interface or a virtual device sits ahead of the tap in the
/// list, and its silence gets recorded as the meeting.

/// channels. Reading the first stream's byte count as frames recorded eight
